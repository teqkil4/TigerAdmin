# TigerAdmin
Not my script, just found a copy of it and I'm hosting it on here and my site so people can use it forever.
```lua
-- Tiger Admin Loadstring
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teqkil4/TigerAdmin/refs/heads/main/main.lua"))()
```

I suggest forking this repo if you dont trust this repo to stay up forever or just download a copy of the src code. To run the loadstring, your executor needs to support game:HttpGet. If it doesn't just execute the raw code.
